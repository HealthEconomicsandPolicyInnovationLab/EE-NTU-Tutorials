# EE-NTU-Tutorials
This handbook is designed for use in the Economic Evaluation course at the College of Public Health, National Taiwan University. The course introduces key concepts in economic evaluation, including the rationale for conducting these evaluations, methods for valuing health outcomes, approaches to calculating costs, and the role of trials as a platform for economic evaluation . It also covers foundational principles of economic evaluation, with a focus on cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), cost-utility analysis (CUA), cost-benefit analysis (CBA), and their application in decision-making processes.  

The course is tailored for heathcare practitioners and is suitable for both Masterâ€™s and PhD students aiming to specialize in economic evaluation or pursue careers in health technology assessment (HTA).

This handbook provides practical exercises using Excel and TreeAge to build decision tree and Markov models, two of the most commonly used techniques in economic evaluation. By the end of the course, students will have the foundational skills needed to apply these tools in real-world economic evaluations.

We would like to extend our gratitude to Professor Ming-Chin Yang for his invaluable guidance, which has enriched this year's course significantly with great depth and inspiration.
